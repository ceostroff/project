Summary

My project will focus on the expenses of attending college, broken down into sections. It will analyze how much the cost of tuition has gone up (or down) in real money and accounting for inflation. This will be compared with the cost of college 30 years ago, when many current college students’ parents attended. This will be national statistics. Cost for the current will also be broken down to address housing, textbooks, tuition and transportation, focusing on state universities and college. Comparison of cost between now and the past will focus on tuition only. To show the current statistics, I will make an interactive map of the main Florida 4-year public and private colleges (UF, FSU, USF, UCF, UMiami, FIU, FAU, UNF, UWF, FAMU, New College, etc.) There will also be an interactive quiz where people can select a college and input their expenses to calculate the cost of college. 

Week 1, Nov. 20-26

I will start to gather all of the data and link the pages in the HTML documents. I will make the charts showing the difference between the costs of college over the last 30 years. I will also start making the quiz questions with the buttons, though the JavaScript to push the page down will not be active yet.


Week 2, Nov. 27-Dec. 3

I will collect data for most 4-year public and private colleges in Florida, putting that information on an interactive chart of the state and plugging in that data to the quiz, allowing it to factor into the quiz-takers’ cost of college.

Week 3, Dec. 4-10

In the last week, I’ll finalize the CSS to make it look pretty (and knowing my eye for color run it by several people). I’ll finish the html quiz form to make it jump down to the next part of the quiz after an answer is given. I’ll double check all of the math to make sure numbers are being added properly and add a section where people can input the amount of financial aid they’re receiving to subtract from the final cost.

Week 1 Review

This week I collected data on each 4 -year public university in Florida's State University System to assess the cost of in-state tuition and out-of-state tuition for 15 credit hours a semester, as well as estimated cost of on-campus housing, transportation, a meal plan, books and supplies and personal expencses. I wound up deciding not to included off campus housing costs as they fluctuate widely depending on area, lease agreement and university. For example, New College of Florida doesn't allow students to live off campus without a waiver granting permission. For the housing section of the quiz, I'll have a disclaimer explaining this. I also chose to base the quiz off 15 credit hours because most degree programs are 120 credit hours, which would be eight semesters. Private schools whose attendance was over 10,000 were used, which I will also disclose. I also collected each school's coordinates for the map. The data in the chart at the top reflects national trends. Once jQuery is added in later, the map will be hidden until people scroll down past the first chart. The quiz questions will be more defined in the next week and will be hidden until an answer is submitted for each. During this week, I ran into a few issues getting the JavaScript to validate for both the chart and map. I knew collecting the data would be the most tedious part of this and am looking forward to perfecting this quiz next week and figuring out how to make the JavaScript understand and return answers and add them together. 


Week 2

This week was supposed to be about my learning how to make the quiz so that based on a person's answers, icons with the schools matching their answers would show and when clicked, would tell about the school. It's been a while since I've faced a challenge this hard. I was not successful in reaching my goal. The code submitted to you has the farthest point I reached with all additions since commented out. I need to figure out how to make and return an array that will show only the schools that have been sorted in the one array made up of the four other variables. I spent about 5 hours each day the past 4 days trying to figure this out. I did make progress on this but for some reason, my initial solution (show in the commented-out part of the code) stopped recognizing classes. I started trying to add the for loops and arrays Friday (two things that have never been my storng suit) and all I can say is I genuinely am determined to figure this out. I will be at office hours this week and the Friday workshop. 


Week 3 

I finally got all of the code working! Huzzah! I decided to take out the bar for scholarships and I'll just add in a line that say that the formula is set up to look a the highest-possible total cost (usually out-of-state) and that for in state students, costs might be less and the full breakdown of in-state cost is under the photos. I still need to style the page and add in a bunch of text and the average debt for the schools, which will just be another chart. Planning on doing this tomorrow and I got caught up in getting to code functional this week. All things still to do I already know how to do and are really just more time-consuming than anything else.
